## Summary
An analysis of Center for Disease Control data about Death rates and life expectancy at birth.

## Description
This project utilizes a data set of information provided by the Center for Disease Control, having originated from the National Center for Health Statistics. The data set is entitled “Death rates and life expectancy at birth”. The question sought to answer revolved around the Average Life Expectancy variable, and the correlation between that expectancy and the Year. 

This data set contains five columns, or variables: 

<ul>
  <li>Year</li>
  <li>Race</li>
  <li>Sex</li>
  <li>Average Life Expectancy (in years)</li>
  <li>Age-adjusted Death Rate</li>
 </ul>

## Motivation
As a society we have come to understand that life expectancy has steadily increased over the years, most drastically in comparison to many (i.e. 100) years in the past. The outcome of my exploratory analysis on this data set does communicate a relevant linear relationship between the Year variable and the Average Life Expectancy variable. Therefore, our understanding that later years mean a higher life expectancy is supported by these data.
